<p>When we are developing this game we want to use death as a game mechanic. So, to complete level you should die intentionally and use your player's body to overcome the obstacles.</p><br/>

<p>This is a horror game placed in a creepy forest. You play as a kid with a flashlight.</p>
<p>You can only see zombies when you point your flashlight to them.</p><br/>

<p>In the code I used "State Machine Architecture" with abstract classes to write more clean code thanks to file seperation.</p>

<p>This game made for a Turkish Game Jam called Atom Game Jam with a theme:<b> You need to cheat to win</b>.</p>

<p>In the code I used "State Machine Architecture" with abstract classes and  "Scriptable Objects As Global Variable" for more extendable code.</p><br/>
<p>This way I did not have much problem when adding new enemies.</p>
